# itunes-to-gpm

This program reads in an iTunes library (exported as Library.xml) and using [gmusic-playlist](https://github.com/soulfx/gmusic-playlist), creates new playlists in a [Google Play Music](http://www.music.google.com) account to match those in the iTunes library. It simply searches GPM using the tags from iTunes, so no guarantee it will find the correct songs!
